* Usage

#+begin_example
q [options] [--] command [command options]
#+end_example

=q= runs a command into background redirecting all its output into
=/dev/null=. Essentially, it is such one-liner

#+begin_src bash
  exec "$@" &>/dev/null &
#+end_src

wrapped in checks so in case of a problem with the command, there is
some feedback.

The command could be either a path or a name to be looked for in PATH.

Options:

- =-h, --help= :: Show usage
- =-q= :: Suppress warnings
- =-V, --version= :: Show version

* Installation

Fetch the archive either from releases or from the development branch, extract
it and put =q= under =/usr/local/bin/=. In case you downloaded the script alone
from github by a raw link, be sure to manually make it executable.

To enable command completion in bash add this to your =.bashrc=:

#+begin_example
  complete -F _command q
#+end_example
